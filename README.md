# setup-xmrig-automatically
Setup the xmrig program to mine XMR, automatically.

This program will help you automate the process of installing xmrig to your linux machine. It will install all the requirements and then ask how you want to mine. After you start mining, either with the program or with your own command, the program will stop and will not run in the backround. The mining is done with the xmrig program. After you can remove this script if you want.

This program will help you start mining XMR and save you some time.

To start the project simply create a file named: setup-xmrig.sh. Then paste the code in there and open a terminal. After that simply type: bash setup-xmrrig.sh and follow the steps of the script. Finally you can start mining when the program prompts you to do it, if you want. Or do it manually, as the script shows in the end.

The script does not collect any information like the wallet address.

I wrote the program to help you get started with mining XMR quickly.
